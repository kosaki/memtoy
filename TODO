memtoy:

More documentation?

	more examples,  usage scenarios, ...

Desired features?

	+ have a race with child quitting and reusing the 
	  same child name in batch mode [scripts].
	  Maybe need a 'wait' command?  Or just don't do that...

	+ don't allow seg names to start with a numeric val
	  so I can give better error messages when seg name is
	  omitted.
		need 'get_segname()' utility fcn.

	+ verify contents after migration?
		e.g., touch <seg> {read|write}[=<value/pattern>]

	+ set_mempolicy() UI

	+ command to toggle verbosity?

	+ echo command to echo comments for scripts

	+ support cpu and memory ranges [n-m] for cpus and mems
	  commands

	+ add 'protect' command to mprotect() as a way to split vmas
	  w/o changing mempolicy.

	+ ...

Done:
	+ fancier UI [command line editing?] or not...
		v0.6c - modified to use readline() 


	+ multiple processes [children] sharing mappings
		v0.4 added 'child' command and command forwarding.
		v0.5 added child response to eliminate races

	+ help summary for help w/ no args.  Details when 
	  command specified.
		v0.4 added cmd_longhelp member to per command struct.
		help_me() updated to show only cmd_help on full list,
		plus longhelp on specific command help.

	+ load seg table with text/data/stack/libs/... from
	  /proc/<mypid>/maps for manipulating same.
		v0.6+  use show '+' to see segs from task maps
		can mbind and touch-read, but not unmap nor
		touch-write.

	+ cpu affinity for testing default policy and migration

	+ debug readline() history recall...
		seems to work in 0.9...

	+ lock/unlock segment in memory?
		added to 0.9a
