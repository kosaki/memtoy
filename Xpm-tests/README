Xpm-tests  -  example tests for Manual Page Migration [MPM], Direct Page
Migration [DPM - 2.6.16 - by Christoph Lameter] and Lazy Page Migration [LPM].

Lazy-old - test scripts that depend on early LPM prototype.  This prototype
	   defined MPOL_MF_MOVE to migrate pages "lazily"--i.e., migrate on
	   fault--and MPOL_MF_WAIT to force migration before returning from
	   mbind().  These scripts depend on memtoy version <0.6.  Retained
	   for reference only.

Manual -   test scripts for manual page migration.  Memtoy "migrate"
           command syntax did not change when moving from Ray Bryant's original
           manual page migration migrate_pages() syscall to Christoph Lameter's
           rework thereof.
	   scripts should still work with memtoy v0.6 and later.

Mbind -    old "lazy" scripts modified to work with Christoph's version of
           mbind flags:  MOVE and MOVE_ALL.  Should work in kernels >=
	   2.6.16 -- e.g., SLES10, RHEL5

Mbind_lazy - a few Mbind scripts with "lazy" added to test migrate-on-fault.
	   requires memtoy 0.7 or later and migrate-on-fault patches.

Stress -   an attempt to wrap memtoy in a shell script to "stress test"
	   page migration -- until I add such capability to memtoy.

zerofile-* are dummy files for testing migration of memory mapped
file segments.
