Poor Man's Migration Stress Test

runloop is a memtoy wrapper script.  It feeds commands to memtoy in a loop
to "stress test" memory migration.  The test scripts are simply memtoy
scripts divided into 2 sections by a "#loop" comment.  commands before
the #loop" comment are fed to memtoy as initialization commands--e.g., to
define map and populate a segment.  commands after the #loop are collected
into a shell variable array, and then fed to memtoy in a loop, the # of times
specified by the '-l <nr_loops>' option.  

For help, type runloop -h, or with no args.

test-mbind-anon-1g contains a sample loop script that uses mbind+move to
migrate just the anon segment.

test-mpm-anon-1g contains a sample script that uses migrate_pages to move
the entire test program.

To really stress the system, you probably need to run a number of these
concurrently, migrating to different sets of nodes, ...
